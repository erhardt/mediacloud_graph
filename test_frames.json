However, West Coast tech media such as [CNET::CNET], [Wired::Wired Top Stories], and [Techdirt::Techdirt] immediately began to raise alarm about COICA and put forth an alternate framing of the bill as anything but benign.

a lull throughout the winter of 2010 and the early spring of 2011, the debate picks up again in the month of May 2011 as Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduces PIPA in the Senate on May 12, 2011. Although Senator Leahy does not appear on this map, [Senator Wyden::wyden.senate.gov] (D-OR), a vocal opponent of the bill, appears at the top of the map (displayed in red) due to an in-link from [Techdirt::Techdirt]. Indeed, in this week, tech media (displayed in light pink) such as [Techdirt::Techdirt], Ars Technica, [Wired::Wired Top Stories], and [CNET::CNET] emerge as critical actors in the debate. [CNET::CNET]’s coverage, while maintaining a critical tone, links out to the [U.S. Chamber of Commerce::uschamber.com] and the [National Cable and Television Association::ncta.com] as strong supporters of the proposed legislation, which accounts for the presence of these private sector actors in this week. The mainstream media, displayed in purple, are present here; however, MSM occupies a far smaller role. From an activism-oriented perspective, what is most notable here is the fact that independent organizations the [EFF::eff.org] on the West Coast and [Public Knowledge::publicknowledge.org] on the East Coast, joined by advocacy organization [Dontcensorthenet::dontcensorthenet.com], each feature prominently as major actors opposing PIPA.

dynamics of May 2011 get even more interesting as the month evolves, particularly when focusing on the week of May 23-30, 2011 in more detail. Here, Senator [Senator Wyden::wyden.senate.gov] occupies a critical role in the media ecosystem, reflecting his May 26, 2011 action in the Senate to place a hold on the Protect IP Act. On the tech media side, [Ars Technica::Ars Technica] plays a particularly large role, as do [Techdirt::Techdirt] and [Broadband Breakfast::broadbandbreakfast.com]. Independent organizations such as [Demand Progress::demandprogress.org] also appear, although this site does not yet feature prominently; similarly, D.C.-based independent organization [Public Knowledge::publicknowledge.org] pops up as a smaller node due to a post on [Dan Kaminsky’s blog::dankaminsky.com] in which he highlights a May 2011 letter on Security and Other Technical Concerns Raised by the DNS Filtering Requirements in the PROTECT IP Bill. In addition to this mobilization in DC, actors from the West Coast such as the [EFF::eff.org] (CA-based advocacy) are also visible in this week.

a relative lull over the summer, the action returns to Congress in the fall with the October 26th introduction of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in the House by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX). Accordingly, D.C.-focused actors such as [Public Knowledge::publicknowledge.org] and Senator [Senator Wyden::wyden.senate.gov] (who had placed a hold on COICA the previous fall and PIPA the previous spring) appear in this week as the media ecosystem responds to this development. Tech media also pop up prominently, including [Ars Technica::Ars Technica], [eWeek::eWeek - RSS Feeds], [GigaOM::GigaOM], and [torrentfreak.com::torrentfreak.com]. Alongside these recurring nodes, the three most important “newcomers” to the discussion in this and subsequent weeks are [Wikipedia::en.wikipedia.org], [Fight for the Future (FftF)::fightforthefuture.org], and Open Congress. At this stage, Wikipedia plays a purely informational role, providing links to the PIPA entry rather than to--as will be the case later on--discussions about mobilization on Wikipedia’s talk pages. [Fight for the Future (FftF)::fightforthefuture.org] and [Open Congress::opencongress.org], both co-founded by Tiffiniy Cheng and Holmes Wilson, come to play a central role from here to the end of the campaign. Here, FftF marks the first major successful use of video in the anti-SOPA/PIPA campaign, presenting a video informational polemic with a point of action to contact legislators. Open Congress offers a complementary model of access to the written materials on the Act, again, with a point of contact and an ability to “vote” publicly on the bill. The [Screen Actors Guild::sag.org] also becomes active in this period, offering a joint statement of industry members in support of the Act; interestingly, this week marks one of the only times throughout the conversation when pro-SOPA perspectives receive in-links comparable to those garnered by voices on the other side of the aisle.

During this period, online sources like the [Huffington Post::The Huffington Post] and [DailyKos::Daily Kos: State of the Nation] and traditional media like the[ LA Times::Los Angeles Times], the [San Francisco Chronicle::San Francisco Chronicle], or [the Hill::thehill.com] feature prominently, although it is worth noting that the [EFF::eff.org], [Techdirt::Techdirt], and [CNET::CNET] appear alongside them. In addition, two more traditional actors, [Free Press::freepress.net] (savetheinternet.com and freepress.net) and the [Screen Actors Guild::sag.org], also emerge. In this week, Free Press gains attention via both a link from the Huffington Post and via a link on its own blog to an online petition in opposition to PIPA, and SAG receives additional traffic to its joint statement in support of the bill via a link from [CNET::CNET], again reinforcing the role of media sources in this week. On the other hand, this week also reveals the potential for mobilization and protest via established institutional channels as well as-- in the case of activism witnessed up to this point-- through newly created campaign-specific sites. Here, the [White House Blog::White House.gov Blog Feed] petition to “Stop the E-Parasite Act” illustrates this dynamic, popping up as a result of links from [Mashable::Mashable!] to the petition page. However, it is worth noting that the White House did not officially respond to this petition until January 2012.

Significantly, beginning in the second week in November and continuing through the end of the controversy, American Censorship, which was initiated by the co-founders of [Fight for the Future (FftF)::fightforthefuture.org], Participatory Politics Foundation, and [Demand Progress::demandprogress.org] with [Public Knowledge::publicknowledge.org], the [EFF::eff.org], and support from the [Mozilla Foundation::mozilla.org], became a major point for coalescence on action, and ultimately the model for the January 18, 2012 protests. Several other instances of notable anti-SOPA activism also emerge this week alongside American Censorship itself. As part of the American Censorship Day protest, the reblogging site tumblr, seen most prominently on the map as [staff.tumblr.com::staff.tumblr.com], offers a mass mobilization platform that automatically connects individuals to their Congressional Representatives. The large presence of the blog [politechbot.com::politechbot.com] also represents the activism of the week, as this site pops up due to in-links to its posting of both a November 15th anti-SOPA professors’ letter, a letter from Internet and technology companies, and a letter signed by members of the international civil and human rights community. At the same time, this week reveals the continued importance of the major outlets, as seen most clearly with the most prominent appearance of the [New York Times::New York Times] during this period. The NYT’s emergence here reflects widespread linking to Rebecca MacKinnon's November 15th opinion piece explaining how SOPA and PIPA would strengthen China's repressive firewall and import part of its capabilities to the United States.

SOPA debates continue to heat up during the last week of November, when several interesting and distinct features emerge. In addition to the obvious continuity of both tech media and SOPA/PIPA activism sites, [YouTube::youtube.com] becomes a prominent platform, although no single video dominates this effect. The [Business Software Alliance::bsa.org] also enters the conversation this week, garnering a great deal of attention due to a November 21st announcement that it has reversed its position and now opposes SOPA. A third set of new actors, research papers, also features here, albeit less prominently. Specifically, [brookings.edu::brookings.edu]  appears due to Allan Friedman's analysis of the effects of SOPA on cybersecurity published on that site, and piracy.ssrc.org pops up as Joe Karaganis at the [Social Sciences Research Council (SSRC)::piracy.ssrc.org] offers survey and research results indicating that the practices targeted by SOPA and PIPA are rare, and that public opinion supports a certain level of “copy culture.” The appearance of Derek Baumbauer's paper, “Orwell's Armchair,” in [SSRN::papers.ssrn.com], driven in part by his own cross-posting and linking on platforms like [Prawfsblawg::PrawfsBlawg], further suggests that academic work that tackles substantive issues can gain visibility. Finally, the presence of [Brad Burnham's tumblr::bradburnham.tumblr.com] here highlights how it is possible for individual voices to feature periodically at critical moments."},{"nodes":[{"id":5842,"label":"PCWorld Latest Technology News","index":0,"story_count":2,"link_count":0,"code_media_type":"Tech Media (A site that focuses on technological news and

the week of December 19, 2011, the digital media ecosystem undergoes a dramatic shift that contrasts with the relative quiet of the previous two weeks. On December 21, 2011, the [House Judiciary Committee::judiciary.house.gov] released a long list of corporate supporters of SOPA, hoping to bolster the claim that SOPA was good for business and innovation. The difference between the map before, depicted in the week of December 12, 2011, and after, depicted here, that event is stark, and provides one of the clearest examples we have of (a) the dynamism of the networked public sphere and (b) the possibility of converting discourse into action. It marks a major mobilization by online users, initiated by a single Reddit user on December 21, 2011, to boycott domain registrar Go Daddy for its support of SOPA/PIPA. In this week, this protest is so significant that the prominence of [Reddit::reddit] and [Go Daddy::godaddy.com] is joined by the emergence of other previously unseen topically related nodes, such as the blog [thedomains.com::thedomains.com], which highlights Go Daddy’s support of SOPA and discusses the quantitative impact of the boycott. This online action was tremendously powerful; indeed, although the Reddit thread originally suggested that the boycott last until December 29th (which it dubbed “move your domain away from GoDaddy day”), Go Daddy retreated and abandoned its support for the acts almost immediately, offering a public statement on its blog by the middle of the day on December 22 and an official news release the following day. This Reddit-led intervention is a notable instance of converting talk into action in the networked public sphere, as well as an instance of how a single speaker, with an idea, can move a large group. This mass mobilization to protect the health of the Internet occurs alongside ongoing expert critique of the law, seen here as law professors Mark Lemley, David Levine, and David Post offer a [Stanford Law Review::stanfordlawreview.org] article entitled “Don’t Break the Internet”. In an example of the diverse range of voices sustaining the conversation, the actors that link to or reprint this piece span the tech media ([TechCrunch::TechCrunch]), the right wing blogosphere ([Instapundit::Instapundit]), and the gaming community ([Kotaku::Kotaku]).

the beginning of January 2012, the action has come back to the center; in the week of January 2, 2012, many of the now-familiar nodes lead the debate, including [Techdirt::Techdirt], [CNET::CNET], [EFF::eff.org] and [American Censorship::americancensorship.org], which pops out as central among sites campaigning against the Act. A number of these actors continue to link to the list of SOPA supporters at the [House Judiciary Committee site::judiciary.house.gov] and to the [Wikipedia::en.wikipedia.org] pages that describe SOPA and PIPA. This week also features a major role by gaming sites such as [Joystiq::Joystiq], [mommysbest.blogspot.com::mommysbest.blogspot.com],[ majorleaguegaming.com::majorleaguegaming.com], and [Rock, Paper, Shotgun::Rock, Paper, Shotgun], among others. In particular, Joystiq underscores the role of gamers as it points to a post by game developer Nathan Fouts at Mommy’s Best Games  in which he encouraged game developers to determine their bosses’ stance on SOPA and urged the gaming community to lobby the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) to cease its support of SOPA. Building from successful earlier activation and protest in late December 2011, this mobilization effort included a clear call to action, complete with draft email text and emails for personnel at the ESA. On the information-sharing as well as activism front, this week highlights an interesting example of the dynamic which we describe as the attention backbone, in which a small site gets attention via links from more trafficked sites. From the earliest stages of the debate, an oft-repeated meme had been that the cost of piracy to the United States is $58 billion each year. This meme was repeated across many stories, including across mainstream media outlets. On January 3, 2012, Julian Sanchez published a piece in [Cato@Liberty::feeds.cato.org] in which he debunked this $58 billion figure; however, few actors linked directly to Cato, and, as the map indicates, Cato (visible in blue in the upper left quadrant) remains very small in this week. Despite the lack of links directly to Cato, the story itself received attention due to an attention backbone, as [Techdirt::Techdirt] directed readers to Cato, and [Reddit::reddit] and the [EFF::eff.org] both then directed users to the [Techdirt::Techdirt] article in conjunction with a link to the Sanchez piece. This series of linkages emphasizes the power of an attention backbone in which a particularly careful takedown (via Cato@Liberty) of a core meme ($58 billion) underlying the campaign gets stated in a place that continues to stay small and unlinked, but then gets transmitted over an attention backbone to the larger sites, permitting the information to rise to the top of the community of interest."},{"nodes":[{"id":21059,"label":"danwin.com","index":0,"story_count":2,"link_count":1,"code_media_type":"Blogger(s) (A web log, written by one or more individuals, that is not associated

begins to ramp up rapidly the week of January 9, 2012 with a doubling of the number of stories from the previous week, increasing from about 400 to over 800. [Reddit::reddit] occupies the most prominent node in the network with links to a January 10th call to action by its admins (“Stopped they must be; on this all depends”) that announces their decision to black out Reddit on January 18, 2012 and includes links to the various campaign sites. The [American Censorship::americancensorship.org] petition site continues to grow in size this week. As this debate continues, [Wikipedia::en.wikipedia.org] serves as both a source of information and a platform for action. Links to the Wikipedia pages that describe SOPA and PIPA remain popular along with links to the talk pages on which Wikipedia contributors, led by Wikipedia founder Jimbo Wales, discuss the initiatives and debate the role that the online encyclopedia should play; these talk pages include deliberation as to whether SOPA is so dangerous to the open Internet that Wikipedia should shut down in protest for a day. Alongside these instances of mobilization and deliberation, the [White House Blog::White House.gov Blog Feed] garners attention this week with a blog entry entitled Combating Online Piracy while Protecting an Open and Innovative Internet, in which senior White House officials respond to petitions against SOPA and related bills and announce that the White House, while sensitive to the problems posed by online piracy, does not support the proposed legislation. The petition drive had garnered over 50,000 signatures using the petition.whitehouse.gov platform, prompting this official White House response. Finally, as seen from the earliest stages of the controversy, tech media sites such as [Techdirt::Techdirt], [CNET::CNET], and [Ars Technica::Ars Technica], continue to be key sources, along with the non-profit advocates."},{"nodes":[{"id":5738,"label":"Error500 - Tecnología + Internet +

week of January 16, 2012, marks the culmination of the debate, with the explosion of action and attention on January 18, 2012, as thousands of sites including [Wikipedia::en.wikipedia.org], [Reddit::reddit], and [BoingBoing::Boing Boing] are blacked out in a mass protest against SOPA. While [Google’s::google.com] landing page remained operable, it offered a link to its “End piracy, not liberty” petition page. Millions of people signed on. In the wake of this massive outpouring of opposition, both the House and Senate versions of the bill were shelved. The week depicted here saw over 3,500 stories on SOPA and PIPA, a figure that represents about 40% of the total number of stories from the introduction of SOPA to its defeat, and about one third of all stories from the 16-month period since the introduction of COICA in September 2010.  In this particular moment of massive mobilization, several of the long-standing core nodes remain visible: [Techdirt::Techdirt], [CNET::CNET], and [Ars Technica::Ars Technica]; [Wikipedia::en.wikipedia.org]; the [EFF::eff.org]; and [Open Congress::opencongress.org] and [Fight for the Future (FftF)::fightforthefuture.org].  Along with the significant role played by Wikipedia, Google, and Reddit in this portion of the debate, it is important to note the scale and diversity of voices present this week. Mainstream media occupy important positions alongside individual blogs, including experts who speak out and rise to positions of widespread public attention via an attention backbone."}]
